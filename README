lcam - ICameraProvider and ICameraDevice bindings for Lua
=========================================================

WIP - at the time of writing this readme, only the Soong bp files and a vendored
Lua is set up. The rest is TBD or not pushed, or the README might not be up to
date (:

Build
-----
- add lcam to your manifest (e.g., as external/lcam) or clone the git manually
- . build/envsetup.sh && lunch <lunch-target>
- m lcam
